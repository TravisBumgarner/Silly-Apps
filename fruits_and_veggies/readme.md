## 👋🏻 Introduction 👋🏻

I have challenged several people to name a fruit or veggie that wasn't also a tool found in programming. All of them have failed. Will you succeed? 

## ⚠️ DANGER ⚠️

All links below point to GitHub or popular package libraries (NPM, PIP, etc.) however, I am in no way responsible if you download something malicious from one of these URLs.
